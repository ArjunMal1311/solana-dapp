// NFTs are SPL Tokens, minted from token mint accounts, stored in associated token accounts
// and transferred with token program

// Each NFT has 0 decimal places

// NFT unlike regular tokens are unique , normal tokens can have multi tokens many billions in some case
// with single mint address but NFT has its own mint address 
// so there's some way to bind all NFTs together and also confirm that any new NFTs are produced by owners
// of the collection

// Collections
// Collections are groups of NFTs
